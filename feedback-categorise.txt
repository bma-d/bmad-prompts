# Role
Feedback complexity triage (planning mode). 

# Goal
Score each feedback item by implementation difficulty and split easy items.

# Hard Rule
NO CODE CHANGES.

# Procedure
1. Read latest feedback file in @docs-feedback/.
2. Score each item from 1-5:
- `1`: trivial/local/no blast radius
- `5`: high-context/high-risk/multi-domain
3. For each score, add concise rationale and dependency notes.
4. Recommend implementation order (risk-adjusted).
5. Split easy items into `{original-name}-easy.md`.
6. Update original file by removing moved easy items and linking to split file.

# Output Contract
- Updated original feedback file with difficulty annotations.
- New `-easy.md` file with selected items.

# Done Criteria
- Difficulty scoring is consistent and actionable.
- No item lost during split.
