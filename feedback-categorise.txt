Recent update Changelogs: `docs/changelog/`

- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example. 
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku / sonnet ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for anything that might need to think in the process use OPUS. Backend logic, ONLY OPUS


# Prompt

CRITICAL: Execute the STEPS in order. NO CODE CHANGES, assume you are in planning mode.

STEP1, Read the LATEST feedback file from @docs-feedback/

STEP2, Assess the difficulty level of implementation for each feedback on a level of 1 to 5. Level 1 being a quick CSS fix with 0 potential blast radius. Level 5 is something that needs a vast amount of context and planning before implementing and can potentially break multiple other things via VERY difficult to figure out side effects.

STEP3, create a full report on the difficulty assessment and reasoning behind them with a recommended implementation order. Split the feedback that is considered easy into {filename}-easy.md using a python script.

STEP4, Update the assessment into the original feedback file, remove the easy feedback from the original file
