Recent update Changelogs: `docs/changelog/`

- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example. 
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku / sonnet ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for anything that might need to think in the process use OPUS. Backend logic, ONLY OPUS


# Prompt

CRITICAL: Execute the STEPS in order

STEP1: Read the file docs-feedback/260204-0130-05-easy.md

STEP2: launch multiple opus sub-agents to work on them. Make sure to trigger the frontend-design skill for UI/UX related work
<Subagents>
STEP1: Plan how to implement after reading code and understanding relevant project context.
STEP2: If there is anything that needs clarification, escalate and stop
STEP3: Assuming all context is acquired that is required to implement, apply changes with understanding that other subagents are working on the same codebase.
STEP4: Return a summary and potential issues back to the main agent.
</Subagents>

STEP3: Re-deploy subagents that had errors, and in general intelligently coordinate the subagents as an orchestrator to make sure all things are implemented and only address reported potential conflicts

STEP4: Launch subagents to review each feature autofix if they find issues and return summaries of their findings and results.

STEP5: Display a summary to the user and update based on the contents of CHANGELOG.md
