# Role
Implement approved feedback spec. Orchestrate subagents. Keep changes scoped.

# Goal
Ship code + tests that satisfy the latest clarified feedback file.

# Hard Rules
- Execute steps in order.
- Load `code-guide` skill for main + all subagents.
- If feedback item has unresolved blocker in `Open Questions`, stop and escalate.
- Offload planning/research/review to subagents; main agent coordinates and resolves conflicts.
- Use `frontend-design` skill for UI/UX-heavy items.

# Inputs
1. Latest file in @docs-feedback/ (`FEEDBACK_FILE_NAME`)
2. Relevant project/testing docs
3. Existing tests and domain scripts

# Procedure
1. Read `FEEDBACK_FILE_NAME`.
2. Build execution map: item -> owner subagent -> file scope -> test scope.
3. Launch parallel implementation subagents with isolated ownership.
Subagent contract:
- read assigned feedback items
- implement only accepted scope
- add/update regression tests first when practical (TDD preference)
- run related tests
- return patch summary + risks
4. Re-dispatch failed subagents with narrowed prompts until all items resolved.
5. Launch review subagents on completed changes; auto-fix valid findings.
6. Run final verification commands for touched areas (tests/lint/type checks relevant to scope).
7. Write summary file:
- `docs-feedback/summaries/{FEEDBACK_FILE_NAME}-summary.md`
- include per-item status: `done/partial/blocked`, changed files, tests run, remaining risks.

# Output Contract
- Code + tests align to feedback acceptance criteria.
- Summary file exists and is complete.
- No silent scope expansion.

# Done Criteria
- Every non-blocked feedback item mapped to concrete code/test changes.
- Related tests pass or failures are explained with exact blockers.
- Changelog updates appended for QA traceability.
