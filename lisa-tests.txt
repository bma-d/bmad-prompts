# Lisa Skill Smoke Tests

# Goal
Validate lisa command execution patterns and waiting behavior.

# Rule
Use `./lisa` (repo-local binary), not `lisa`.

# Test Cases
1. Interactive wait/count flow via lisa session.
2. Non-interactive wait/count using bash loop via lisa.

# Expected
- Commands execute without path/permission errors.
- Timing behavior is correct (2s interval).
- Output is deterministic enough for follow-up automation.

# Notes
Record exact commands and outputs for reproducibility.
