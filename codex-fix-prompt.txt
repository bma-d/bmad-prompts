- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according the changelog-auto skill
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.


# Prompt

Reference frontend/.agents/testing.md for frontend tests and the scripts/run-e2e-isolated.sh script on how to run them isolated and reference the existing test types per domain in frontend/package.json.

Read the LATEST feedback file from @docs-feedback/ and implement it. The file was created by an inferior agent compared to yourself, keep that in mind while addressing the feedback.
