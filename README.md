# BMad Prompts

A collection of prompts for BMad projects.

## Prerequisites

- Your project must be a BMad project
- These prompts assume a specific BMad setup—if yours differs, they may not work as expected

## A Note on Usage

The best way to use BMad is to follow the **BMad method** properly.

That said, sometimes you just want hacky fixes done quickly. For those moments, these prompts will often be more than enough.

**Don't apply these blindly.** Always adapt based on your repo's structure and conventions.

Happy BMadding!
