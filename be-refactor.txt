- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Based on the difficulty of each delegated task, assign gpt-5.1-codex-mini / gpt-5.2-codex adaptively for subagents.
- Use gpt-5.2 adaptively for research tasks
</Init>

Use multiple subagents to reference each file from @docs-for-llm/effective-go/ to increase the quality of the backend Golang code. This is a refactor, nothing should break post refactor.

After the subagents provide reports, consolidate the information and task multiple subagents s.t. there are minimal conflicts to address all the issues found.
