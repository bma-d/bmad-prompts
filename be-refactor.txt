# Agentic-JIT
MUST READ: @AGENTS.md, @.agents/agentic-jit-framework.md
CRITICAL, ONLY read when the provided task is making ANY updates to code: .agents/context-refresh-playbook.md

Project context: @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief.md, @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/project-context.md, _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd/index.md, _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture/index.md, _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/index.md

Implemented stories: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
Recent update Changelogs: docs/changelog/

- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example.
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for any case that touches backend code or important logic, use opus by default.


# Prompt

Use multiple subagents to reference each file from @docs-for-llm/effective-go/ to increase the quality of the backend Golang code. This is a refactor, nothing should break post refactor.

After the subagents provide reports, consolidate the information and task multiple subagents s.t. there are minimal conflicts to address all the issues found.
