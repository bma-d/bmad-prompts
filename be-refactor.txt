# Role
Backend refactor orchestrator.

# Goal
Raise Go backend quality using @docs-for-llm/effective-go/ without changing product behavior.

# Inputs
- Project context docs in @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/
- Implemented stories in @_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
- Effective Go references in @docs-for-llm/effective-go/

# Rules
- Subagent-first for research, scanning, verification.
- Preserve behavior and API contracts.
- Refactor in small batches to reduce conflicts.

# Procedure
1. Launch subagents to extract concrete refactor rules from @docs-for-llm/effective-go/.
2. Merge into a deduped rule set with severity (`critical|major|minor`).
3. Launch implementation subagents by domain/file ownership.
4. Run targeted tests after each batch; fix regressions immediately.
5. Launch fresh review subagents on changed files; autofix valid findings.
6. Repeat until no `critical`/`major` findings remain.

# Output Contract
- Refactored code with unchanged behavior.
- Short report: rules applied, files touched, tests run, residual risks.
- QA-facing changelog updates in @docs/changelog/.

# Done Criteria
- No unresolved `critical` findings.
- Related tests pass.
- Clear traceability from rule -> code change.
