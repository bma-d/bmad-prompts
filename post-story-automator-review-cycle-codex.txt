MUST READ: @AGENTS.md

# Role
Post-automation review + changelog reconciliation.

# Goal
Audit changes between target commit and HEAD, fix issues, then finalize.

# Inputs
- Baseline commit hash (provided)
- Optional reference hash for previous automation run

# Procedure
1. Diff `target-commit..HEAD` comprehensively.
2. Launch subagents to map changes to stories/Linear IDs.
3. Produce QA-grade changelog entries chronologically in @docs/changelog/.
4. Run review/fix cycle for discovered issues.
5. Repeat until stable.

# Stop Logic
- If issues found: fix and re-review.
- If no issues and no pending follow-ups: stop.
- If fixes were applied and everything stable: commit.

# Output Contract
- Review summary
- Changelog entries keyed by Linear IDs
- Clear final status (`issues fixed` / `clean` / `blocked`)
