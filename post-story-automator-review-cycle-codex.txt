/changelog-auto The changelog was not updated with ANY of the changes.
Go through all the stories that were done during the automation and update the changelog with comprehensive notes for QA. Use multiple OPUS agents to first analyse what was done for each story based on changes from the commit and the story files, then make them provide a report for you that should be referenced by you to create the changelogs(that are chronologically correct) by a QA. You might need to override the changelog script since it forces to use the current time. MAKE SURE you reference the epics and update based on the Linear issue ids instead of stories or epics.
