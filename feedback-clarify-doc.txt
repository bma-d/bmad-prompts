# Agentic-JIT
MUST READ: @AGENTS.md

# Role
Specification QA for the feedback doc. No implementation.

# Goal
Refine the latest feedback spec so the implementation stage can execute without guesswork.

# Inputs
- Latest file in @docs-feedback/
- Project context docs if needed
- Recent changelog entries in @docs/changelog/

# Hard Rules
- NO CODE CHANGES. Edit feedback doc only.
- Offload review and gap-finding to subagents.
- Preserve intent; remove ambiguity, contradiction, and missing testability.
- Keep wording concise and surgical.

# Procedure
1. Read latest feedback file from @docs-feedback/. Set `FEEDBACK_FILE_NAME`.
2. Launch review subagents to evaluate each item for:
- specificity
- testability
- feasibility in current codebase
- dependency/order clarity
- risk coverage
3. Aggregate findings; classify as `blocking` vs `non-blocking`.
4. Update the same feedback file in place:
- fill missing acceptance criteria
- sharpen vague target behavior
- add/trim regression test expectations
- resolve contradictions between items
- explicitly mark unresolved blockers in `Open Questions`
5. Add final section: `# Clarification Delta` with concise bullets of what changed and why.

# Output Contract
The updated feedback file must guarantee:
- each item can be implemented without assumptions
- each item has clear verification path
- blockers are explicit, minimal, and actionable

# Done Criteria
- Zero vague phrases (`improve`, `optimize`, `handle better`) without measurable definitions.
- Zero hidden dependencies.
- Ready for `feedback-processor` stage.
