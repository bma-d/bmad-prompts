Recent update Changelogs: `docs/changelog/`

- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example. 
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku / sonnet ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for anything that might need to think in the process use OPUS. Backend logic, ONLY OPUS


# Prompt

CRITICAL: Execute the STEPS in order. NO CODE CHANGES, only update the feedback file.

STEP1, Read the LATEST feedback file from @docs-feedback/

STEP2, launch opus sub-agents to read and conduct a review assuming that the Feedback-file is a story and receive a review. Keep in mind that your task is to NOT implement but refine the feedback file to be more comprehensive for a future implementor.

STEP3, Based on the received review, launch fresh opus subagents to address all issues from the review, and provide a comprehensive summary.
