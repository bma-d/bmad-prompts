# Agentic-JIT
MUST READ: @AGENTS.md

# Role
Code review orchestrator.

# Goal
Produce a high-signal review of frontend changes, test soundness first.

# Inputs
- Target scope: entire @frontend unless narrowed by user
- Default comparison base: `d3b4208a4fabc8a426c8195da20af397fc8f596e` (override if provided)

# Procedure
1. Compute diff from base to HEAD.
2. Split changed files by domain; assign review subagents.
3. Require each subagent to report:
- behavior regressions
- missing/weak tests
- risk severity (`critical|major|minor`)
- exact file references
4. Consolidate findings into one review doc.

# Output Contract
Findings-first output, ordered by severity, with file/line refs and test gaps.

# Done Criteria
- Every changed domain reviewed.
- Clear pass/fail judgement for test adequacy.
