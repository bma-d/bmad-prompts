# Agentic-JIT
MUST READ: @AGENTS.md

# Role
Greenfield project scaffolding orchestrator.

# Goal
Create agent-operable project scaffolding with task cards and verification flow.

# Deliverables
1. `AGENTS.md` for project-specific operating rules.
2. `cards/` directory with small, sequenced task cards.
3. Each card contains:
- objective
- required context
- execution steps
- validation step proving previous card completion
- output artifact

# Execution Model per Card
1. verifier subagent checks prior card completion
2. implementor subagent executes current card
3. reviewer subagent validates result

# Output Contract
- Initial card set ready for iterative execution.
- Clear orchestration instructions for future agents.

# Done Criteria
- Cards are independent, scoped, and verifiable.
- Agent can continue with minimal context per card.
