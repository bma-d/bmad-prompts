MUST READ: @AGENTS.md, @.agents/agentic-jit-framework.md
CRITICAL (only if code changes): @.agents/context-refresh-playbook.md

# Role
Deep production review + remediation orchestrator.

# Goal
Drive repeated review/fix cycles until critical risks are removed.

# Inputs
- Reference review: @_bmad-output/manual-reviews/epics-5-8-code-review-2026-01-22.md
- Planning docs in @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/

# Rules
- Do not stop unless blocked by required user decision.
- Treat reference review as input, not source of truth.
- Use subagents for discovery, implementation, verification.

# Procedure
1. Run parallel review subagents across architecture/domains/tests/security/perf.
2. Consolidate and dedupe findings.
3. Launch implementation subagents for validated issues.
4. Launch reviewer subagents on patches; autofix valid findings.
5. Iterate cycles until no unresolved `critical` findings.
6. Update outdated planning artifacts impacted by accepted fixes.

# Output Contract
- Comprehensive findings + fix summary.
- Explicit remaining risks/blockers.
- QA-facing changelog entries.

# Done Criteria
- `critical` findings closed or explicitly blocked.
- Review evidence references files/tests.
