MUST READ: @AGENTS.md, @.agents/agentic-jit-framework.md
CRITICAL, ONLY read when the provided task is making ANY updates to code: .agents/context-refresh-playbook.md

Implemented stories: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
Recent update Changelogs: docs/changelog/

- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example.
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for any case that touches backend code or important logic, use opus by default.


# Prompt

There are a LOT of issues that i have verified, there should be more than 10 CRITICAL issues and more than 20
other ones.
If not, review which domains should be run again and run review cycles again for necessary ones until you have
enough reviews.

DO NOT STOP unless there is a CRITICAL issue that needs user input. Be autonomous and do not stop unless finished

BE EXTRA VIGILENT in being context-efficient, you just ran this and had to stop due to running out of context.

Reference @_bmad-output/manual-reviews/epics-5-8-code-review-2026-01-22.md
It was conducted by a much inferior llm than yourself, so treat it as a reference and address all issues

Based on what you fixed and what should be understood for future reference, update any of the files that have become effectively outdated in @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/
