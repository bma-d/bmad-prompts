Project context: @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief-turno-2026-01-07.md, @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture/index.md, @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd/index.md, @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/project-context.md, @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/index.md

Run @.claude/commands/bmad/bmm/code-review.md for all work done for @_bmad-output/orchestration/feedback-automator/run-20260123-005038.md 

Append all updates that should be referenced by QA to CHANGELOG.md. Prepend with the result from running `Bash(date +"%y%m%d-%H:%M:%S")`

Understand context by reading anything necessary to know how the project is structured and what the project's
intent is. Find and understand this by going through files in @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/
Go through every single story in @_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/ using multipe agents. Tie the related
ones together for a single agent to handle. Tie by domain so that each agent ideally doesn't need to read the same
files, though foundational files are ofc necssary.

Use Opus for difficult tasks and Sonnet for easier ones.

After every agent has provided a review, the main agent(You) should have received reports from every agent.
Consolidate the information into a single file and output into @_bmad-output/manual-reviews

There are a LOT of issues that i have verified, there should be more than 10 CRITICAL issues and more than 20
other ones.
If not, review which domains should be run again and run review cycles again for necessary ones until you have
enough reviews.

DO NOT STOP unless there is a CRITICAL issue that needs user input. Be autonomous and do not stop unless finished

BE EXTRA VIGILENT in being context-efficient, you just ran this and had to stop due to running out of context.

Reference @_bmad-output/manual-reviews/epics-5-8-code-review-2026-01-22.md
It was conducted by a much inferior llm than yourself, so treat it as a reference and address all issues


//	Codex
Based on what you fixed and what should be understood for future reference, update any of the files that have become effectively outdated in @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/
