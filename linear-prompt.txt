Recent update Changelogs: `docs/changelog/`

- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example. 
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku / sonnet ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for anything that might need to think in the process use OPUS. Backend logic, ONLY OPUS


# Prompt

Linear issues:

Launch opus subagents to make the issues more specific for an LLM that will work on it. Your task is NOT to create a tasklist, but to make them more specific. After all bullet points have been made more specific, output them into a file in @docs-feedback Make sure the filename is `{Bash(date +"%y%m%d-%H%M")}-{##}.md`(Run the command) with ## as the no. of feedback
