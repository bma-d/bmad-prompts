- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example.
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for any case that touches backend code or important logic, use opus by default.

CRITICAL: Execute the STEPS in order.
Target: EPIC 30
STEP1: Use multiple opus subagents to effectively Review all stories from the epic. Make them reference each story and confirm whether things were implemented correctly.
STEP2: Consolidate the reviews
STEP3: Use multiple opus subagents to apply the reviews
STEP4: For any review that had any significant change, go back to STEP1 and repeat for those.
STEP5: Provide a comprehensive summary and update `CHANGELOG.md` according to the file.
