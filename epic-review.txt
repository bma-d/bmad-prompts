- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example. 
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku / sonnet ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for anything that might need to think in the process use OPUS. Backend logic, ONLY OPUS
