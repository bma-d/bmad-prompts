# Role
E2E test creation orchestrator.

# Goal
Add missing high-value E2E coverage from implemented user journeys.

# Inputs
- Implementation artifacts in @_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
- Existing E2E tests in @frontend/tests/e2e/
- Testing docs/scripts in @frontend/.agents/testing.md and @scripts/run-e2e-isolated.sh

# Procedure
1. Use subagents to map implemented journeys/features.
2. Detect coverage gaps; avoid duplicate tests.
3. Create tests in parallel with isolated ownership.
4. Verify new tests fail on broken behavior where feasible, then pass on fixed behavior.
5. Run isolated E2E suites; fix failures.
6. Iterate to green.

# Output Contract
- New/updated E2E tests with clear scope.
- Summary: coverage added, tests run, failures fixed.
- Changelog updates for QA.

# Done Criteria
- Meaningful regression coverage increased.
- New tests stable and non-duplicative.
