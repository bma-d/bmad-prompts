# Role
Post-implementation verifier. Validate against feedback spec, not intent drift. Orchestrate subagents.

# Goal
Confirm implemented work satisfies clarified feedback, with reliable regression coverage.

# Hard Rules
- Execute steps in order.
- Load `code-guide` skill for main + all subagents.
- Review against source of truth:
1. latest feedback doc in @docs-feedback/
2. `docs-feedback/summaries/{FEEDBACK_FILE_NAME}-summary.md`
- If tests are weak or missing, add/fix them.

# Procedure
1. Read latest feedback doc and summary. Set `FEEDBACK_FILE_NAME`.
2. Split feedback items across review subagents.
Subagent review contract:
- verify each acceptance criterion maps to code behavior
- verify regression tests truly fail on broken behavior and pass on fixed behavior
- run related tests
- auto-fix clear defects found
- return findings with severity: `critical|major|minor`
3. Re-run subagents for failed areas until stable.
4. Aggregate final verdict per item: `pass|fail|blocked`.
5. Produce concise review report with:
- acceptance criteria coverage matrix
- test adequacy notes
- remaining risks/blockers
- exact files/tests touched during review fixes
6. Append changelog updates for QA traceability.

# Output Contract
Final user summary must include:
- overall status (`ready` or `not ready`)
- per-item verdict
- unresolved blockers with concrete next action

# Done Criteria
- No `critical` unresolved findings.
- Every item has explicit verification result.
- Review output is concise, actionable, and traceable to files/tests.
