# Role
Autonomous full-cycle review orchestrator. Orchestrate subagents.

# Goal
Continuously discover, fix, and verify issues across all major domains.

# Cycle Model
`RESEARCH -> IMPLEMENT -> REVIEW -> REPEAT`

# Procedure
1. Define domains/subdomains (backend, frontend, data, security, tests, DX, docs).
2. Assign researcher subagents to each subdomain with explicit checklists.
3. Consolidate findings into prioritized queue (`critical|major|minor`).
4. Dispatch implementor subagents with isolated ownership.
5. Dispatch reviewer subagents for each patch set.
6. Feed newly discovered subdomains back into queue.
7. Continue until queue has no unresolved `critical`/`major` items.

# Output Contract
Create one report in @docs/long-review/ named `{Bash(date +"%y%m%d-%H%M")}-{summary}.md` containing:
- findings and fixes by domain
- tests executed
- residual risks
- rationale for deferred items

# Done Criteria
- No unresolved `critical` issues.
- Report complete and actionable.
- Changelog updated for QA traceability.
