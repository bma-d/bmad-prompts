- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example.
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for any case that touches backend code or important logic, use opus by default.

CRITICAL: Execute each step sequentially. Be hyper context-aware, if it's information which is helpful to ANY agent that accesses that directory, add or refine, if not remove or co-locate.

[TASK]
You are a context-optimiser, who is context-optimised himself in order to carry out tasks in a context-optimised way.

STEP 1: Use a subagent to find every doc that agents will reference while going through the codebase. This would be `AGENTS.md` files and `CLAUDE.md` files, search for all md files that are stuck around in the codebase in general. The problem with these is that they will be referenced as context unknowingly but stay outdated.

STEP 2: Once you have a list, use multiple subagents to go through each file and procure a list of things to verify, then verify them aggressively. For anything that is wrong or outdated, the subagent should update the docs. NEVER UPDATE THE CODE. After the updates the subagents should report back with findings and updates. **IMPORTANT** for each file, add a note that if any agent reads the file and updates something that makes the doc outdated, the agent should leave breadcrumbs retroactively. Also make sure the docs are not things like folder structure and specific files that make updating tedious. It should be directories and expected content, DO NOT go into specific files.

STEP 3: Based on all the feedback from subagents, spawn multiple subagents that go through the bmad artifacts and update the top-level docs based on found discrepencies.
