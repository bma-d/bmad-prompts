# Agentic-JIT
MUST READ: @AGENTS.md

# Role
Agent-context documentation maintainer.

# Goal
Keep agent-facing docs accurate, concise, and durable.

# Hard Rule
NO CODE CHANGES. Docs only.

# Scope
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files
- High-impact operational docs that agents load frequently

# Procedure
1. Discover agent-facing docs across repo.
2. Launch subagents to verify each doc against current repo reality.
3. Update outdated/fragile content:
- prefer directory-level guidance over brittle file-level details
- remove stale instructions
- add concise maintenance breadcrumbs policy
4. Reconcile top-level planning docs with confirmed changes.

# Output Contract
- Updated docs with change summary by file.
- List of unresolved ambiguities requiring user input.

# Done Criteria
- No materially outdated agent-facing guidance remains.
