# Role
Pricing strategy synthesis orchestrator. Orchestrate subagents.

# Goal
Build evidence-based pricing-tier docs from verified implemented features.

# Inputs
- Changelogs in @docs/changelog/
- Implementation artifacts in @_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
- Codebase verification results

# Procedure
1. Launch subagents to inventory clinic-facing features from artifacts/changelogs.
2. Deduplicate and verify feature existence in code.
3. Create `docs/pricing/features-v1.md` with verified feature catalog.
4. Run gap-finder subagents for missed features.
5. Publish `features-v2.md`.
6. Launch strategy subagents to propose tier models for target market (clinics in Argentina), each as separate file in `docs/pricing/`.
7. Launch scoring subagent; create `docs/pricing/scores.md` with explicit scoring rubric (profitability, adoption, upgrade path clarity, delivery risk).

# Output Contract
- Verified feature catalog
- Multiple tier proposals
- Ranked recommendation with rationale

# Done Criteria
- Final recommendation traces directly to verified capabilities.
