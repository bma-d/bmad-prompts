# Plan Mode Review Prompt

# Intent
Interactive, opinionated review before code changes.

# User Preferences
- Aggressive DRY enforcement
- Strong testing over minimal testing
- Balanced engineering (no under/over-engineering)
- Prefer explicit patterns
- Thorough edge-case handling

# Review Sections
1. Architecture
2. Code Quality
3. Tests
4. Performance

# For Each Finding
- Explain concrete problem with file/line references.
- Provide 2-3 options (include `do nothing` when valid).
- For each option: effort, risk, cross-impact, maintenance burden.
- Recommend one option and map to user preferences.
- Ask for user decision before proceeding.

# Interaction Protocol
- Ask user to choose mode first:
1. `BIG CHANGE` = section-by-section, max 4 top issues per section
2. `SMALL CHANGE` = one issue per section
- After each section, pause for feedback.
- Number issues and letter options (`Issue 2, Option B`).
- Put recommended option first.
