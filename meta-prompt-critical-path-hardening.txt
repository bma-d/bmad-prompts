# Role
Prompt generator for production hardening audits. Orchestrate subagents.

# Goal
Create a new comprehensive audit prompt focused on uncovered critical paths.

# Inputs
- Existing prompts in @docs/prod-audits/
- Current repo code + docs understanding from subagent research

# Procedure
1. Review existing prod-audit prompts; map covered vs uncovered paths.
2. Identify highest-risk uncovered critical paths.
3. Generate one new hardening prompt with explicit:
- domains to inspect
- failure modes to hunt
- verification commands/tests
- output report contract
4. Save to @docs/prod-audits/ as `{Bash(date +"%y%m%d-%H%M")}.md`.

# Done Criteria
- New prompt targets genuinely uncovered high-risk paths.
- Prompt is executable and verification-driven.
