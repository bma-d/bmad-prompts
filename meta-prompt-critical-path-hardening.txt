Based on your research and understanding of this repo by going through code and docs using multiple subagents,

I want you to provide a comprehensive prompt that will go through every critical path of this application and review the implementation and harden the entire application for production. Save the prompt into @docs/prod-audits/ as `{Bash(date +"%y%m%d-%H%M")}.md`(Run the command)

Reference the prod-audit prompts in @docs/prod-audits/ and focus on paths that were not focused on.
