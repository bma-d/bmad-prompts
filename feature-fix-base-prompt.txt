/bmad-bmm-dev-story I have feedback, figure out which stories you should read in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts` before trying to address the issue.

Project context: @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief.md, @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/project-context.md, _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd/index.md, _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture/index.md, _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/index.md

<Init>
- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example.
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku ONLY for SIMPLE manual tasks, for any case that touches backend code or important logic, use opus by default.
