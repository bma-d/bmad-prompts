- Append all updates that should be referenced by QA according to CHANGELOG.md. 
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user. Pass this to subagents as well
- YOU are the implementor. Read extra files yourself iff necessary, BE HYPER context-efficient and offload any research / search / verification / exploration task to sub-agents by default. ONLY use the Context7 MCP through subagents You are the consumer and implementor, not the researcher.
- Offload simple / manual tasks to subagents and scripts. ie) offload 'manual' tasks and anything that doesn't require active thinking in the process. i18n is a great example.
- Based on the difficulty of each task, assign opus / sonnet / haiku adaptively for subagents. Use haiku ONLY for VERY SIMPLE manual tasks, for any case that touches backend code or important logic, use opus by default.

[TASKS]
CRITICAL: This task requires NO CODE CHANGES

Step1: Use two sub-agents to traverse through the front and the back end and figure out potential features that can be gated by a pricing tier. Use Opus and make sure this is an extensive report

Step2: Consolidate the information and use multiple sub-agents to verify the consolidated information(BE and FE should have suggested roughly the same features)

Step3: Based on the verification, provide a list of features that can be gated and how it can be done.

Wait for the user's confirmation, future steps will be provided with my feedback.

Step4: Reference the user's feedback and create a `docs/FEATURE_GATE_PLAN.md` with a high level plan on how to implement



//	manually defined refactor
STEP1: split these into subagents to research what needs to be done.
- Component logic should only cause re-renders for components that should be re-rendered, split them where possible.
- This repo should ONLY be using tailwind unless it's deemed impossible to do with tailwind.
- Shadcn/ui should be used where possible and if new components are needed generate them with the CLI and apply

STEP2: Once you have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, use multiple subagents and task them with the refactors. Try your best to make sure their work does not cause conflicts

STEP3: Based on the updates from subagents run all necessary tests, and if anything breaks re-iterate with subagents until fine.

STEP4: Update CHANGELOG.md



//	Vercel refactor
Use multiple subagents to reference every aspect from the vercel-react-best-practices skill to increase the quality of the frontend code. This is a refactor, nothing should break post refactor.

After the subagents provide reports, consolidate the information and task multiple subagents s.t. there are minimal conflicts to address all the issues found.
